JavaMailSenderUtil
==================

It is an Android application which uses a develped class to send emails using JavaMail library and does not require use Gmail Intents.
If you want to use it and develope your own mail client you can use it under the GNU General Public License(see LICENSE file).

I would like to enhance the MailSender class adding new useMailProperties****() functions. 


NOTICE
------
JavaMailSenderUtil uses the javamail-android library. 
This library is based on the opensourced version of JavaMail and activation (JAF) available in the glassfish repository, and some parts of Apache Harmony's opensource implementation of AWT.
It is made up of 3 jars (additionnal.jar, mail.jar, activation.jar)

The source code is available under same licenses as JavaMail which is:
- CDDL-1.0
- GPL-2.0
- BSD

You can download the used jars, see sources and  the license term at https://code.google.com/p/javamail-android/
